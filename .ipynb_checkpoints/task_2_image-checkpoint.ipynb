    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Link:\n",
    "RGB Dataset can be found at \" /data/rgb-images/ \" in the respective challenge's repo.<br>\n",
    "DICOM Dataset can be found at \" /data/dicom-images/ \" in the respective challenge's repo.\n",

    "#### Description:\n",
    "Images are needed to be preprocessed before feeding them into computer vision algorithms. Comman forms of image data are: 2D, RGB, dicom format, satellite images and 4D images. 2D images are grayscale images, RGB images are 3-channel representing color value of pixel, DICOM format is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data, and 4D images (example - brain MRI) are slices of 3D images stacked on top of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "How to load and process various formats of image for machine learning (Check out helpful links section to get hints)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "- Read the rgb images provided and store their numerical representation in numpy array (matplotlib or PIL)\n",
    "- Plot 9th rgb image\n",
    "- Print dimensions of 12th image\n",
    "- Convert last 5 images to grayscale and plot them\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the dicom images provided (dicom.read_file function)\n",
    "- Print numerical representation of image '0009.DCM' (dicom_img.pixel_array attribute)\n",
    "- Plot any dicom image (matplotlib.pyplot.imshow function)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further fun (will not be evaluated):\n",
    "- You already got familiar with complex unstructured data like rgb and dicom images, let's apply those skills to 2D images as well. Download the famous MNIST Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data . Read those 2D images and explore the data. Try out edge detection using sobel filter without using libraries other than numpy.\n",
    "- DICOM format contains much more information than just pixel values. Explore the data further.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helpful Links:\n",
    "- Awesome tutorial on image processing with numpy: http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2016/Oct/23/image-processing-with-numpy/\n",
    "- Understand pydicom data structure and images - https://www.kaggle.com/avirdee/understanding-dicoms"
