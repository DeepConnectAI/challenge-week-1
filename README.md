# Week 1 Challenge

## The different types of data that is commonly encountered is-
### - Tabular (rows and columns)
### - Text
### - Image
### - Video
##
##
## Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. 
## Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues. Data preprocessing prepares raw data for further processing.

##
## In this week's Challenge we'll learn how to preprocess Tabular, Image and Video data.
##
### - The challenges will require the use of various of libraries like numpy, matplotlib, pandas etc. 
### - If you're new them then it's important to note these libraries take time to learn and master.
### - However, these tasks can be performed by using the articles and official documentation of the respective libraries.
### - The aim is to make you familiar with them, not master them in one week.
### - As the course progresses you'll find that these versatile libraries are absolutely necessary to learn.
